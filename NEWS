THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "systemfit" PACKAGE

Please note that only the most significant changes are reported here.
A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN repository
on R-Forge.


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1-14 (2012-11-17)

* changed dependency ("Imports") from "stats (>= 2.15.0)" to "stats (>= 2.14.0)" 


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1-12 (2012-06-02)

* added nobs() method for objects of class "systemfit"


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1-10 (2011-11-11)

* slightly revised the package vignette so that it works with version 2.0
of the "sem" package


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1-8

* the systemfit package now works with version 2.0 of the "car" package
(linear.hypothesis() has been renamed as linearHypothesis())


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1-6

* the logLik method now uses the average number of non-NA observations per
equation (instead of the number of rows of the residual matrix, which might
include NAs) to calculate the log-likelihood value: hence, the likelihood value
is correct now even if there are NAs in the data; the calculation of the
log-likelihood value for unbalanced systems uses the conditional density
function for the unbalanced observations assuming that the errors of
not-included observations are zero (the log-likelihood value was incorrect
before if there were NAs in the data)

* the logLik() method now takes the number of (linearly independent)
coefficients from element "rank" to calculate the degrees of freedom, because
this is correct even if there are NAs in the data (it was incorrect before if
there were NAs in the data)

* the logLik() method now returns (as attribute "nobs") the correct number of
observations even if there are NAs in the data (it was incorrect before if there
were NAs in the data)


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1-4

* model.matrix.systemfit.equation() now returns a matrix (and not a vector)
  even if the equation has only one regressor (including the constant);
  this fixes bugs in model.matrix.systemfit() and predict.systemfit()
  that occured if (at least) one equation has only one regressor


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1-2

* the subfolder "tests" and the test scripts in this subfolder are no longer
  included in the R package in order to reduce the time for checking
  this package on CRAN


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1-0

* added a NAMESPACE file

* the returned fitted values, residuals, and the model frame include *all*
  observations now, where fitted values and residuals of observation
  that were not included in the estimation are NA

* systemfit can estimate systems of equations with unequal numbers
  of observations now


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-4

* added our JSS paper about systemfit as a vignette


            CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-0 AND BEFORE
